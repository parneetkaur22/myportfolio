                        <p>These days I am doing my co-op at Web-studio Toronto, this is a amazing company where I am working now, they are very professional I have learned many things here. Further, I work as Security Guard in Toronto, this is my favorite job I did a lot of hard-work to get this job, when I came to Canada I face a lot of problems to find work, then someone told me that you should go for Security Job but for that, firstly I got Security Training then, I gave my Exam then after that, I got my License then I gave my Interview. After that I got job, these days I am working with Garda World Security Company according to me they are best people with whom I am working these days. Everyone ask me this question you are in Web-Designing Program then why you choose the Security Job then I always say that I want to be an Police officer so thatâ€™s and in the Security field I will get more experience then after that I can get Police job. Its my childhood dream to be an Police Officer its not easy to get this job, but I will do hard-work to get that job soon I know it takes time, but its true that nothing comes easy we need to work for that.</p>
